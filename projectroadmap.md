# Project Roadmap - mini space shooter game

# Projects researched
- https://github.com/tasdikrahman/spaceShooter - 
I researched this to learn how to handle collisions, movement, and other aspects in a PyGame space shooter.

# Key ideas to implement:
- Insert explosions and background noises using "pygame.mixer".
- Using Sprite groups for efficiency
- Collisions logic for bullets and enemies

# What we'll use differently 
- Add an animated background (later)
- Design a custom scoring system and possibly a difficulty system

# Next Steps
- start laying down code and testing it
